Python Homework
This was an activity in which we used python to first access CSVs and then perfrom analysis.
The first activity, PyBank, required us to analyze a company's Profits/Losses.  These Profits/Losses were tracked on a monthly basis and broke into to columns, month/date and Profit/Loss.  We then also determined the total profit/loss, the average change of profit per month, and the Max/Min profit/losses.
The second activity, PyPoll, required anayzing voting data to determine who the candidates were, what portion of the vote they got (count # and % of total), and to determine who was the winner of the election.
This was a very exciting activity and I am extremely excited to apply what I have learned to real work problems in the work place.
